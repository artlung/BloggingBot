American Essay: WAITING FOR THE TALKING POINTS not much word yet from conservative pundits on Katrina
American politics may be getting vitriolic, but I think it's worth stepping back and looking at the political security landscape.
Americans are almost as ignorant as Italians.
Americans are great not because we're so good at rallying together.
Americans at the bottom are also improving, and that is great, but we don’t want that degree of inequality.
Americans do not argue, even to themselves, that their actions may be justified by raison d'etat.
Americans even share Europe's aspirations for a more orderly world system based not on power but on rules--after all, they were striving for such a world when Europeans were still extolling the laws of machtpolitik.
Americans have never accepted the principles of Europe's old order, never embraced the Machiavellian perspective.

An excerpt: Nathaniel Heatwole is a student at Guilford College. Several times between February 7 and September 15 he tested airline security. First he smuggled box cutters, clay simulating plastic explosives, and bleach simulating bomb-making chemicals through security. Then he hid these things in the lavatories of airplanes, along with notes. And finally, he sent an e-mail to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) titled "Information Regarding 6 Recent Security Breaches." The problem is that the TSA never asked him to test their security.

As a Being of Light, I hereby resolve to live, love and be happy, at all costs, no matter what, with reverence and kindness for All.
As a bonus, I can tell you that Bergamot Station is worth visiting anytime.Richard Gate: Zzyzx RoadFor some weeks I've been enjoying the vicious and rather dirty blog uncov -- which attempts to  deflate Web 2.0 hype by exposing the crap that passes for clever technology, they are particularly cruel to TechCrunch, who does seem to hype each and every dumb startup and site to the moon.
As a Christian child in Japan, Endo was taunted by his peers for his religion.
As a credentialed and licensed Respiratory Care Practitioner, I sometimes get email like this, and just got this a few days ago: Hi Joe, I came across your details and wondered if you would be open for new opportunities in Saudi Arabia for a respiratory therapist position.
As a fortysomething, I remember Captain Marvel on screen - my tv when I was a kid.
As a journalist I can take it as well as dish it out.I love Roger EbertFred Fish - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
As a longtime blogger, and "moblogger" as we used to call it in the form of Foursquare and Twitter, I essentially have lived out in the open 15 years.
As a man who would mow folks' lawns and spent lots of time outside, he he has had small cancerous and pre-cancerous growths for years.
As a matter of fact I have posts queued up for the weekend and Monday.
As a matter of fact, I think I still have the clothes she made for my Snoopy.
As a memorial, go read one of her articles.
As a Navy wife of a WWII and Korean War vet, they moved often, having 6 kids born in 4 military towns.
As a person who as a kid was always drawing, this sickens me.
As a person who dealt with a small number of schizophrenics working at the public library, then a rather larger share working in hospitals, it evokes many memories.
As a platform vendor, you're only as successful as the people who build on you.A more subtle problem is when platform vendors don't think they have a platform, they think they have an application.
As a pure exercise in wordless storytelling it seems pretty interesting.

As a reminder, I've been posting material here since 2001. 2015 marks 14 years of postings.
As a Respiratory Therapist I know they do good, but the quality of life attendant to such a machine I don't find them compelling.
As a result, I didn’t get as much out of that drawing class as I could have.
As a result, it was a great day.
As a result, your current profile on Mash will no longer be available.
As a sometime 405 commuter, I'm amazed at what the the *motorcycles* do, let alone what bikes could do.
As a stepparent I have little if any real authority over the kids, except to back up and support my wife.
As a student come to France after World War II to study Catholic novelists, his faith was irrelevant to those who may have shared it, but who deplored him nonetheless because he was Japanese.
As a teen I would be sure to buy the LA Times, because I was a little snotty about LA being the "real" city.
As a teen Swimmer's Ear didn't slow me down much except the first time, when I think my Dad warned me that if allowed to go unchecked, the infection could cause real damage: I could develop pus, hearing loss or worse -- it could end up killing my ear and the surrounding tissue.
As a visual designer, keeping my visual mind active is important.
As a web developer, I appreciated the use of Apache and MySQL to keep track of the cluster, and to have the machines report their status and structures. The variability of commodity hardware makes simple hard disk mirroring - which I believe is the way things like Beowulf work - chancy.

Basically this is a Third World country where if you're part of the ruling oligarchy you can make huge bucks through connections and kickbacks. If you're not born into the right family, however, you must choose between low-paying service jobs and emigration. The ruling oligarchs, like most of the natives, are black. The tourists and the rich expats are mostly white. This leads to occasional conflict. For example, it is actually illegal to walk around "downtown" streets wearing a bathing suit top and the police ticket the cruise ship passengers who aren't aware of this rule. As one local put it "there is nothing that black policemen like more than giving tickets to white people." Tapwater in the Carribean It is generally unsafe to drink tapwater in the Caribbean. An island may appear to be a pristine desert. How could the well water be unsafe? It isn't well water. The only water available is probably rainwater that is collected in a cistern and left to stew in its own bacterial soup for a few weeks. Of the places covered in this guide Puerto Rico probably has the safest tapwater and the Dominican Republic the most lethal. American influence leads to crime Property and violent crime against tourists does exist, however, and as usual the United States is the leader. Puerto Rico and the U.S.

BlogRush didn't grow without its fair share of problems -- from security issues to abusive users trying to 'game' the system to much lower click-rates than expected.

City Life In theory the cities of North America offer the opportunity to socialize a lot of fascinating people, to learn new ideas and skills, to appreciate art and entertainment, and to have challenging and rewarding work. In practice it seems that crowding and high real estate prices force most citizens into working 60-hour weeks so that they can meet their mortgage and SUV payments. In theory it should be possible for Joe Wornout to back down to a shabby apartment and a used Honda Civic and change to a lower pressure job.

Communication is hard man.
Communication usually fails, except by accident. If communication can fail, it will If communication cannot fail, it still most usually fails If communication seems to succeed in the intended way, there's a misunderstanding If you are content with your message, communication certainly fails If a message can be interpreted in several ways, it will be interpreted in a manner that maximizes the damage There is always someone who knows better than you what you meant with your message The more we communicate, the worse communication succeeds The more we communicate, the faster misunderstandings propagate In mass communication, the important thing is not how things are but how they seem to be The importance of a news item is inversely proportional to the square of the distance The more important the situation is, the more probably you forget an essential thing that you remembered a moment ago

For example, in 2005, only two headers were made, and you can see as you visit each successive month, the headers scarcely change.
For example, in my marriage, at times I would get upset with my soon-to-be-ex wife about housework, call it "Thing Y" -- at heart I might be upset and resentful about "Thing X," but instead of actually talking about Thing X, I would be a jerk about Thing Y.

Force majeure (French for "greater force") is a common clause in contracts which essentially frees one or both parties from liabilities when an extraordinary event beyond the control of the parties, such as flood, war, riots, acts of God, et cetera prevents one or both parties from fulfilling their obligations under the contract.
Force majeure precludes an international act from being wrongful, where it otherwise would have been.

Forgiven?
Forgiveness is the mental and/or spiritual process of ceasing to feel resentment or anger against another person for a perceived offence, difference or mistake, or ceasing to demand punishment or restitution.
Forgiveness may be considered simply in terms of the feelings of the person who forgives, or in terms of the relationship between the forgiver and the person forgiven.

Freethinkers also acknowledge that there is an inner, private, subjective world of human experience.
Freethinkers attach much more importance to the 'why' of belief than to the 'what.' Freethinkers believe in the sort of human understanding that naturally follows from a careful and rational consideration of the relevant factual evidence.
Freethinkers believe that if life is to have authentic meaning, they must create it or discover it for themselves.
Freethinkers consider this life as the only one we can be sure of having.
Freethinkers, therefore, look for and find meaning in their daily lives: in their efforts to learn, to grow, to understand, to help others, and to try, at least, to leave the world perhaps a little better place than they found it.

Friday is the best thing.
Friday night Leah and I went and saw the movie adaptation of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy - which we both enjoyed.
Friday night will be a casual cocktail party here at CCHS with tours led by our students for those interested, light food, music, and beer and wine.
Friday was especially odd because as I was exiting the pool, she asked me "sir do you want a kickboard oh sorry." All one breath like that, but she only decided to ask me as I was climbing the ladder to get out.
Friday when I faxed my timesheet to the contracting company, it didn't go through.

If the W3C can reconcile the new policy with this stated goal, then it's win-win for us all.

He's awesome!
He's been blogging for a long time now - and a google search finds references to "Respiratory Therapists" , "RTs" and "Respiratory Terrorists." Which used to be a kind of compliment.
He's been funny before, too.Casablanca-styleI get the neatest email.
He's been playing football even longer.
He's blue eyed and semi-hispanic with a bizarre sartorial flair.
He's circumspect, he's cautious, he tries to defend the family.

He's doing the intro now.Dirk is doing pre-show banter...Blogger is not behaving.Another test...Going to try and blog this live.Testing.
He's engaged! That's so cool.
He's fact-checking the North County Times (NCTimes.com) / KOGO / Pro-troops misinformation (Kynn paints it as malpheasance, I'd say it sounds more like lazy reporters who should know better).
He's fearless in that way, unafraid to include racial epithets and the rawest slang to make his characters come alive.

He's just a man, and a father, and a brother-in-law.
He's just the kind of nurse it was a pleasure to work with.

He's not convincing me, but he never fails to make me laugh. I must take issue with a number of items on your "don't like" list... Winnie the Pooh Yes, I know you feel it promotes ignorance, but it's not about being stupid, it's about innocence and naiveté. There's nothing wrong with that in today's world. The problem with Winnie the Pooh now is that it's been so bastardized by the Disney Company that it no longer resembles that. Pink Floyd This I cannot understand. Maybe you mean the post-Roger Waters stuff.

He's silent, he's murderous, he scared me as a kid!

He's still quite talented, see Greazel.com.
He's still reticent to come out and play, but he sat on the bed with Leah and I for about an hour tonight, watching The West Wing.

He's trigger-happy in this image.Han Solo, 1977
he's trying to equalize
He's united the entire world against him." In his brusque, go-it-alone approach to Congress, the UN and countless nations big and small, Bush seemed to be saying, "Go with us if you will, but we're going to war with a small desert kingdom that has done us no harm, whether you like it or not." This is a good line for the macho business.
He's urged to apply to Juliard.
He's using the litter box as he should, and is not so perturbed at us he might do any retaliatory marking or peeing.
He's very fun to watch, and having him on my shoulder makes me appreciate the way movie pirates have Parrots on their shoulders.
He's writing a third book.
He’s led a life to be proud of, I’m proud of and thankful to him.
He’s led an extraordinary life.

Here are some of my favorite excerpts: On Puerto Rico's place vis-a-vis the USA Puerto Rico is interesting politically. The island is home to 4 million American citizens who don't pay federal income tax, aren't represented in Congress, and don't vote for president. Most of the Puerto Ricans whom I encountered were against statehood on pragmatic grounds. They get nearly all of the benefits that any American might get from the federal government, including welfare for mothers and children, defense, flight service, air traffic control, etc., but they don't have to pay for these benefits. On racial tensions in the Virgin Islands There is a fair amount of racial tension in the U.S.

Highlights included Thanksgiving with a turkey roasted in a Hotel room, quality time with the kids, who are now ages 16 to 21 and we are so proud of them; a playoff game for the boys that they unfortunately lost; seeing Tangled, which was good, going to a pub that was pretty good called Ladyface with Devon; visiting with my friend Chris and his great kids Diana and Zac (my godson); including having his tire go flat on the way to Kinokuniya in Costa Mesa; free wifi on Virgin America airlines both ways; reconnecting with my friend Vince and his beautiful family and house on the way from DC to Roanoke.
Highlights were two bits of grooming:
Highlights: sloppy joe's _(natch)_, killer scrambled eggs _(featuring cheddar jack, soy milk, and water)_, oatmeal, baked custom sandwiches, breakfast burritos-to-go _(featuring leftover scrambled eggs)_, and miscellaneous goulashes.

Hirstute argot.V for VictoryI told you before I was taking a class in 3D graphics and animation.
His advice for living: enjoy every sandwich.
His application was built in Flash/ActionScript and it did various semirandom actions when you would put a finger down.
His approach involves a series of thumbnail sketches and maquettes, from which one is chosen to be executed full scale.
His best books are oversized, superdense with words and text, very innocently drawn, but definitely educational.
His best known work may be Why's (poignant) Guide to Ruby, a book which teaches the Ruby programming language with stories; its eclectic style has been compared to a "collaboration between Stanislaw Lem and Edward Lear".
His body had burned through Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs downward to the basic needs: safety and biological.
His body temperature varied.
His body was nearly invisible, an abstract pattern approximating the scribbled brickwork sliding smoothly across his tight one piece.
His body was too spent, too weathered, to survive.
His book is pretty cool, too.Cruel IronySometimes I have a very hard time writing here.
His book: The Creative Priority : Putting Innovation to Work in Your Business - is another thing I need to put on my shopping list.I saw Jerry Hirshberg speak...New item for The Lab:Some bookmarklets which I can never remember where to go get.
His boots would be taken and his suit of red searched.
His boxes to this point have all been covered style, like a little doghouse.
His breathing was labored.
His campaign made a go of it.
His color even worse.
His comic Empowered comic manages to be satirical and yet dramatic, ridiculous and yet science fictional and superheroic.
His commanders now are empowered to act in concert with strategic guidance.
His concept is AdSafe.
His continuously shifting allegiances and stances show a human being utterly divorced from notions of service, public works, or even coherent moral principles.
His description of always seeking Art of Noise product at every record store he went to resonates with me.
His desire to return, it seemed, had little to do with Hussein and everything to do with loyalty to country.
His eighth album, Something Deeper Than These Changes, takes the listener on intimate journeys into Stew's past.
His enthusiasm for that film was infectious.
His famous-forever statement that "everyone would be famous for 15 minutes" was inspirational, and his knack for plugging into the zeitgeist with his art was great as well.
His feet were cool to the touch.
His flight was canceled for Saturday night, so he and his ski club took a van from Atlanta, and so I trekked over mostly cleared-ish roads in 5&degree;F weather.
His former owner couldn't keep him at his new apartment, so he had to let him go.
His full name is purported to have been Paul Ronald Ryan, though this is not certain.
His generous, loving spirit, curiosity and love of life have endeared him to all who have been touched by him.
His girlfriend, Louise Neri, is a well-known art curator.
His honesty, style, and audacity were inspirational to me.
His insights into how the modern age is scarcely worth satirizing are worth the price of admission, and there's much more.
His interview on The Sound of Young America was quite good.
His kid was a kid when he worked with me, now, Vincent is in college and takes photos like the above.
His last, and now deleted post was:
His latest project, Hackety Hack, is a Ruby-based environment used to teach programming to children.
His life's obsession was complete, the reunion he had dreaded and pined for for decades came true, and he died soon after.
His love of life I'm sure was simply being glad he had come so far from that hardship.
His most vocal critics describe him as "a fledgling freelance professor, should one adhere to the most fraudulent of definitions." His biographical information, matter of point, is riddled with accolades which are clearly either lifted or falsified in order to cast him in a good light -- let's say 40 watts of violet."
His mother is not alive.
His new autobiographical show, Passing Strange, starts previews this week at the Public Theater and features an original score with close to 20 songs.Village Voice on Passing StrangeCheapest in town:
His one aim is to disarm suspicion, to arouse confidence in his orthodoxy, to avoid challenge.
His photos are great too, though I bet he has newer ones now. :-)
His point is a good one.
His pop work, his aesthetic, his work with Roxy Music, his production of a panoply of bands: incredible body of work.
His pottery makes great Christmas gifts, too.
His PowerPoint is the essence of what Thomas PM Barnett describes as the SysAdmin force. 		(tags: iraq politics powerpoint history) 	 	 		Microsoft's Vista isn't compatible with SQL Server - Dec. 15, 2006 		Say what? 		(tags: microsoft sqlserver stupid) 	 Daily LinksOne of the great cliches of Christmastime is the airing and re-airing of It's a Wonderful Life.
His presidential aspirations are tragic and Faustian.
His show is like the best old public television - This Old House or Victory Garden.
His skin blotchy and clammy.
His spleen was enlarged and he went into shock, then there was nothing that could be done for him.
His style is an interesting mix of subtle realistic touches and interesting graphic touches.
His talk is full of insights that are very vivid.
His thesis is that by subjecting Americans to ever-increasing levels of screening, security, humiliation ("show your papers and take off your shoes?") we are slowly instituting a police state in this country.
His top major donors include financial firms Merrill Lynch & Co., Credit Suisse First Boston, UBS Paine Webber, and Goldman Sachs Group.
His voice astonishes.
His voice is genial and adequate, but he had the rubber-faced presence to make each song vivid.
His WAP has WEP and won't play nice.
His work involved beautiful women, rendered in a graphically austere way.
His work is impressive.
His work is really challenging, and makes me uncomfortable often.
His work spans gritty realism, fanciful mania, and for Playboy, delightful cheesecake.

Ussally at Christmas they read from the Gospel of Luke Chapter 2 because it gives the full account of the good news. He appeared to the shepherds first. In those times shepherds were considered unclean and untrustworthy. Shepherds may have been chosen because they represented all who needed cleansing. Jesus was a king for all those humble enough to see their need for a Savior. Jesus had a supernatural beginning which is a sign of his divinity. He was human and divine. Just thought you would like to know the truth. Love you son, Mom :-) Thanks so much for the clarification Mom! More on the trip to Utah soon...From My Mom...

Who else but God can make Love last 1 trillion years of sweet eternities! For when conquered after years of toil, sweat, blood, Love can strike like greased lightning sent by God! To spark mere dust to intense blazing fire & create the unity of God's spaceship Earth, as all mankind desire! Bronner's Almond Soap quart poem teaches 'How to Love' uniting All-One above!

It's some kind of affirmation.
It's something about living an aesthetic life.
It's something to do with the beauty of things as they age and are impermanent.
It's sort of a small town.
It's sort of as though peace talks are starting.
It's sort of my "todo" list of links.
It's sort of the opposite of what I was saying about wanting that precise line.
It's starting.
It's still a great time to be working on web stuff.
It's still a supremely cute machine.
It's still a very mixed bag out there.
It's still in print, and you can usually find it out at the larger chain bookstores, or even via Amazon.
It's strange that I wanted this.
It's strange to me to see this drawing, because it takes my mind back to the moment when I found him, and calling the code, and working on him, "breathing" for him.
It's strange to visit Mark Cuban's Blog and see that my very own name "Joe Crawford" is right there on the first post.
It's strange,
It's strange.
It's stretched my OO skills in PHP5, and stretched my understanding of REST and lots of other stuff too.
It's striking to me that a class I took for a few months 17 years ago has left such vivid memories.
It's stuck with me though, this problem of comments.
It's stunning to me that it's 17 years old now.
It's suitably odd and enjoyable.
It's Sunday evening now, and Leah is doing a little gardening.
It's Sunday morning.
It's Sunday--Mother's Day.
It's super!
It's supposed to be about material prosperity and cleverness.
It's supposed to have a melancholy feel.
It's ten years I've been married to the same woman.
It's terribly out of date, and I find people asking for it.
It's that aspect of games I find the most compelling aspect--mostly because it's the part I least understand.
It's that simple!
It's that simple.
It's the best part of the web.A little bit of my art used in a video
It's the bold experiment called "joint custody" and I think it portends great things.
It's the culmination of 30 or so years of my enthusiasm for Star Wars.
It's the definition Colin Powell used when he told the world Saddam had weapons of mass destruction.
It's the definition David Kay used when he set out to find the weapons.
It's the distinct whoosh of a tank of gas.
It's the documentary of the life in Hollywood of one Robert Evans.
It's the engine inside Safari and KDE browsers.
It's the first self portrait I ever made I was really happy with.
It's the kind of data mining we've all grown used to.
It's the kind of identity hack I'm pleased to try out.
It's the magic hour now, very pretty sunrise today.
It's the night before Independence Day.
It's the one country in the region where the people like us; and it's the government that hates us.
It's the original "Hayseeds" TMBG shirt.
It's the same as the instagram-surveillance panopticon really, just a bit slower and more manual.
It's the same thing that's made Google possible I mean think about what Google does, we take hundreds of millions of fairly hard queries a day; the queries tend to say things like 'searching for camels in Tanzania' and we sort of shake our head and try and figure out what that means and we go over petabytes of content, not terabytes but petabytes of content.
It's the story of a very large gorilla who lived in the jungle.
It's the truth: most people are not funny.April Fool's DayAnd I look over yonder
It's the uploads.
It's the voice of an artist with a unique and ambiguous point of view.
It's the wrong thing to do.

It's thorough, and he put it together for school.OpusAlone In The Night by joe it has to be okay to be alone in the night the emptiness of aloneness could be interpreted as an opportunity for independence for self-sufficiency but sometimes the aloneness just feels hollow and the result is sorrow and the result is sadness and the result is despair and the result is insomnia and the result is pain and the result is crying and the result is intractable and the result is ugly and the result tortures me but i must learn to be alone in the night to not depend on another person or even an audience for comfortAlone In The Night Janece is a CURRENT WebSanDiegan.
It's thought provoking and troubling.
It's time for a change.
It's time for me to let go.
It's time for someone with a different emphasis; it's time to not elect someone because a family member of theirs has been President before.
It's time for war.
It's time I 'outed' myself as a cranky cookie eater here on the blog.
It's time to ask the U.S. hard questions about how Sept. 11 was allowed to happen is a difficult article from Lawrence Martin of Canada's Globe and Mail.
It's time to catch up with everything I've let slide.
It's time to claim my place in academia, and sink or swim on my own merits.
It's time to get back in the swing of things after a long hiatus.
It's time to go through these old files and keep what's good, and scrap what sucks.
It's time to join the 21st Century maybe.
It's time to start fixing it.
It's time to take control of the many and various abilities to communicate to the world.
It's titled: Why not to use blur() to make dotted lines go away in MSIE for Windows.
It's too bad the rest of the party couldn't muster the will to execute on compromises to get something out of a popular idea--healthcare in the USA needs fixing.

It's too late.
It's trivial to keep all this data.
It's true.
It's two movies.
It's ultra-simple but it's also quite fun.
It's unconscionable, I tell you.
It's undeniably snarky, but rings true.
It's unflattering, or she doesn't like how her chin looks, or some other criticism that I can't remember because of course I look at the photo with my eyes, not her eyes.
It's ungentlemanly.
It's UNISYS' fault.
It's us, the onlookers.
It's usually minimal traffic, and free parking, and any chance to hit Los Angeles is a good excuse.
It's validating xhtml and css and everything, just like Jeffrey Zeldman would like.
It's verb enough for this interview.
It's very difficult to define science fiction.
It's very frustrating to be so "ahead" on paper and not have the dollars in the bank account, we're perilously low.
It's very green out here:
It's very interesting to peer inside my head at 13.
It's very much like half-a-broccoli and half-a-cauliflour.
It's very plain, and does not vary from the default Bootstrap colors.
It's very pretty there, but where we were there is not enough surf, just harbor.
It's voting, right?
It's wet.
It's what happened.
It's what I love about Stew, a music artist who I actually have met in person, who I think is a genius, and knows me well enough to ask me to make a blog and a powerpoint template for him.
It's where I first heard Thomas Barnett.
It's where I pulled off the major coup of getting Leah a copy of Savannah Smiles for our Anniversary last week.
It's where Leah and I met, and where we started our journey.
It's worked out well for me.
It's worse every year.
It's worth a read: Newsletter: Month Fifty and Fifty-one
It's worth re-watching start-to-finish.Omar & Brother MouzoneQuote of the Day from Clay Shirky:
It's worth reposting here.
It's worth visiting a Comic Book shop for.
It's wrong.
It's xhtml compliant, and was a blast to do.
It's years of family training to NEVER EVER EVER EVER EVER lose your keys, or your passport, or your proof of insurance, or your bank book, or leave your keys in your car, or forget your home phone number or address or else the GODS OF BUREAUCRACY WILL PUNISH YOU AND YOU WILL NO LONGER DESERVE TO HAVE THE SURNAME CRAWFORD.
It's your kind of kitten.
It's, what, idealistic realpolitik?
It’s a beautiful spot.
It’s a big beautiful world! Happy Valentine’s Day to Leah and everyone! ❤️We (the government) regulate hairdressers and car exhaust and doctors and lawyers and how you add a new room to your house and we license you to drive a car and regulate boats and regulate your speed on the interstate and how you educate your children and test whether your toys are safe and whether your lettuce is clean and we regulate what the word “organic” means on a food package and we regulate how people houses are sold so it’s fair and we monitor air quality and we regulate how much you get paid on unemployment and we regulate how and who can vote and we have rules on lead in paint and we regulate if you can own a ferret in some places.
It’s a little bit depressing.
It’s a place where everyone is welcome who wishes to explore what it means to have a mental disorder, be in a relationship with someone who has a mental disorder and all the other things that go along with that including medication, depression and self-help techniques.
It’s a temple to knowledge.
It’s a trap for the rest of your life because the laws are designed so that you can’t get out of it.
It’s also evidence about how secretive this administration is.
It’s been a heckuva year so far.
It’s been a pleasure,
It’s been silkscreened on a shirt now.
It’s beyond the scope of this blog to talk specifics, but let’s simply say that I made some grievous mistakes in my youth, for which I have atoned.
It’s entirely possible we’re headed for a climate-ravaged corporatist dystopia of inequality that mirrors feudalism.
It’s important to me and my health — mental and physical.
It’s irresponsible, it’s obnoxious and offensive.
It’s just great to be alive and I take nothing for granted.
It’s like a dream, no end and no beginning
It’s neat and connects people.
It’s never an easy decision to shut down a feature, especially one like AOL Journals that some of our members have used for a long time.
It’s not easy to stand apart from mass hysteria—to believe that most of what’s in the financial news is wrong or distorted, to believe that most important financial people are either lying or deluded—without actually being insane.
It’s not the only thing out there, but it’s an important thing.
It’s not unlike what we’ve done here in this interview – multiplied several thousands of times a year.
It’s now December 25th.
It’s scary to change careers a short inspirational comic by Karen X.
It’s when you come to hate working on something so much that it inspires a surge of productivity that leads to completion.
It’s worthwhile to learn about unfamiliar heroes.
It’s a beautiful morning.
It’s a whole different world in terms of media consumption.
It’s definitely a drawing that was made with the aesthetic of “do it fast and do it now” — I think I may have been sad at the time given the melancholy of the pose.
It’s moments like this I really treasure, to share the little bits of ephemera in my brain.
It’s mostly magazines and such, but they’re lovingly preserved out in that garage.
It’s no fun to look at the laziness and hubris of my eighteen year-old self.
It’s not one of my better qualities.
It’s small, but it was a lovely time.
It’s so strange to think now, that this design class was all analog.
It’s still there, but I understand it much better.
It’s time for breakfast.

Joe, we are here. I saw him get off the plane. They put him on the cart with all the luggage. I picked him up and he was quiet the entire ride home. He immediately hid behind the sofa downstairs. Then I started talking to him and gave him some food, which he refused and now he is investigating every nook and cranny downstairs in the utility room. He looks great! He is going to have a wonderful Life in Roanoke. LOVE YOU SO MUCH, Mom :-)

Last but not least I want to say that I hope the failure of this service doesn't in any way discourage other entrepreneurs from coming up with crazy ideas at 4AM (like I did with this one) and from "going for it" to just try and see if something will work. Without trying there can be no success. And as we all know, ideas are worthless without action. The Web wouldn't be what it is today without entrepreneurs trying all sorts of crazy ideas.
Last Christmas Leah's family went to a hall (a Mormon church hall as it happens) and sang Christmas carols.
Last Friday saw Sin City - graphically amazing, but too violent and graphic.
Last Friday, just 3 days ago, I got a call from my mother early in the morning saying that he had made a turn for the worse.
Last great article I read was in the February 2005 issue of Esquire -- a great article called Bush, Part Deux: A Strategy for Making Everything Turn Out OK, by Thomas PM Barnett.
Last month Flaming Moe's suited me perfectly.
Last month I replaced it with another service.
Last month I was able to sell them.
Last month, I got re-tested.
Last night and this morning I added a Referer tracker for the San Diego Bloggers page in PHP/MySQL.
Last night as I was making my way from work to my car I was greeted by the sight of Lara Croft and Indiana Jones -- apparently now a couple -- moving northeast in the Gaslamp Quarter.
Last night I actually dreamt about some medical procedures I used to do as an RT (and may do again sometime soon) -- specifically I remember doing an ABG (arterial blood gas).
Last night I could hear the boom of rifles being sighted in at the range east of town.
Last night I exercised my art jones a bit.
Last night I got into a conversation with a fellow "on a journey of changing and growing" (as I am) about free will.
Last night I left Los Angeles for Roanoke, Virginia.
Last night I made a phone call to the person Jenny said she was going to see romantically - Jeremy.
Last night I saw "Stranger than Fiction" and was moved.
Last night I took some time and imported all those delicious bookmarks and have revived, symbolically, "Semidaily."
Last night I went to the North County AngularJS Discussion Group / sandiegojs group at WalmartLabs here in San Diego.
Last night I went to the SIGGRAPH Los Angeles event held at the EA facility in Marina del Rey.
Last night Jenny and I saw Will, a co-worker at AVENCOM play guitar and sing there.
Last night Leah and I visited a bookstore after dinner and I looked at a book called Beautiful Code.
Last night Leah, Alison and I went to see Brokeback Mountain.
Last night she was feverish, in pain, and honestly we were concerned that we might need to go to the Emergency Room.
Last night she was looking as poorly as I've ever seen her.
Last night we had a flash flood of ants show up in the kitchen.
Last night with the kids was pretty great.
Last night, and this morning I cried.
Last Saturday there was a short article on the front page of the Ventura County Star about Wi-Fi hotspots, the focus was on for-pay hotspots, with little emphasis on free wireless projects or the municipal projects that are happening.
Last sighting (and first kill) was October 30th. (here's my and Leah's account).
Last summer, the FCC passed another round of sweeping pro-consolidation rules that, among other things, further raised the cap on the number of TV stations a company can own. In the media, as in any industry, big corporations play a vital role, but so do small, emerging ones.
Last Sunday Leah and I went to St.
Last Sunday’s Washington Post reported that both of them had misgivings about the program, but neither did anything about it.
Last time I decided to go I asked for, and got a ton of great suggestions as to what to do.
Last time I was here? 44-ish years ago.
last time we had a song on a teen oriented tv show we got tons of email from adults who just "happened to have the tv on at the time and heard your music" along with alot of folks who "never watch that show but just happened to be watching it that night to see what all the talk was about." But the best email we got was from someone who said they were watching tv with the sound down and then heard our song...really.
Last week Devon and I sneaked away and saw an afternoon showing of _Revenge of the Sith_.
Last week I asked my friend Chris, who I've now known for 22 years, if it makes sense that I would have a desire to swim or go to the beach -- like "is it consistent with my teenage self that I would obsess like this" -- I think I was expecting something like "well you liked the water then, but it was never crazy per se." He surprised me with something I apparently said when I was living with him and his wife, which was "I haven't been to the beach in 4 days, I'm getting cranky."
Last week I picked up Brian Wilson's Smile, and it's brilliant.
Last week I served my jury duty service in Ventura County, and when I say "served" what I mean is that after 5pm each day, I called to see if my number was being called.
Last week I spent a great deal of time learning the ins and outs of the business, getting a feel for the underlying technologies and systems.
Last week I took her to Ikea, and she got some really cool stuff.
Last week I went and saw Blade Runner with my friend Chris Greazel.
Last week it rained cats and dogs.
Last week my part time gig moved offices.
Last week was a short week owing to Memorial Day, so it was a four day week.
Last week was hard.
Last week was so busy -- not enough walking.
Last week was the 7 year anniversary of my blogging here on artlung.com.
Last week, on Thursday, my wife Jennifer, from whom I have now been separated for four months, had our last session of joint counseling. "Last session of joint counseling" may sound like a negative thing.
Last week's news did not reflect Wells Fargo at its best.
Last weekday of this trip.
Last weekend I attended BarCamp LA 4, and had a terrific time.
Last year after Jenny picked up the phone and talked to her Mom on the phone, I immediately checked my email.
Last year I noted that I like the implications of forceful, big waves:
Last year I picked up the book Superman on the Couch, a pretty good exploration of the psychology of superheroes from a cultural and social perspective.
Last year I remember the Batgirl meme.
Last year the sh*t hit the fan in my life.
Last year, or perhaps the year before, I picked up a nude drawing reference at Comic Con.
Last, he is the supreme enemy of Satan and the fallen angels.
Lasting impact, zero.
Lastly (for this post) I've been enjoying work very much.
Lastly on the kid front, I really am finding myself a patriarch.
Lastly, here's me from the train earlier.
Lastly, I am still sick.
Lastly, Leah and I will both be changing our names here soon.
Lastly, unlike C3PO I don't ever say "No more adventures."
Late getting out here but really cool.
Late Night was dadaist, silly, ironic, observant genius.
Late NightYesterday I saw the new Indiana Jones movie with Jukebox JT and his wife, and the seeing and the talking after was fun, but the movie is not, uh, good.

Lately God is found at the beach.
Lately I have a relationship happening, with a woman, that is occuring at a breakneck pace.

Later on, we had lunch and saw paparazzi, as Leah chronicled.
Later revelations, such as the Church and Pike congressional investigations that revealed CIA plots to overthrow governments and kill Castro with exploding cigars and poisoned wetsuits, only added to anti-government paranoia.
Later taters!
Later taters.
Later that year:
Later this month, we will be shutting down tvtag and its supporting apps in order to refocus our efforts on other initiatives.
Later this year, if all goes as planned, China will become the third country to send a citizen into space.
Later we had on Forget Paris, which I did not care for very much.
Later we talked about adornment with tattoos and piercings, and their moral right or wrongness at Leah's folks' place.

Later, I got Tiger's Milk bars (love 'em!).
Later, I made this (and other things) but I'm only showing this:
Later, I saw that it will be closed till the end of June.

Mom doesn’t have any of these things working against her and so, as Dad says, mom is “way off the charts,” “in the 96th/99th percentile,” and “is going to blow them out of the water.” In summary, if there is one person who can beat kidney cancer it’s going to be mom.

MonoTouch runs only on Mac OS X, and integrates tightly with XCode and the iPhone SDK.
MonoTouch uses C#, and Adobe's tool that releases tomorrow uses Flash (so, ActionScript).
Monotouch, meanwhile, has a much more reasonable point of view, and views the changes as merely proposed and not final:
MonoTouch's C-powered runtime blends the power of native code and Apple's iPhoneOS APIs with type safety, automatic memory management, and other benefits that years of runtime innovation have delivered to the ISO Common Language Infrastructure.
MonoTouch's programming model exposes the iPhoneOS API to the C# language to give developers the same control and access that Objective-C developers get.

Most of us see these as good things because a hairdresser not meeting standards can hurt you and cars with too much emissions cause smoke and untrained doctors and lawyers are a terrible idea and you need to learn to drive a car properly if you’re going to drive and if you’re going to teach your kids yourself you aught to do it right and if the lettuce isn’t clean you can get really sick and if something is “organic” it should actually mean something and the real estate business has a really shady history of treating people different based on race so we need to fix that and we should keep track of air quality because again, health and yes we should make sure people who vote have the right to vote (although more of us really should vote because we all have a stake in this world) and lead in paint has this really terrible history of hurting people bad and while I don’t understand why some places don’t allow ferrets, even worse I have no idea why my idea of monitoring and regulating firearms better — as in, in such a way that we maybe get less people killed every year — makes me Un-American.

Mostly people sunbathing or just chilling.
Mostly we ended up with places in Simi Valley (further from the kids!) that we were not crazy about, or places in Moorpark that were too expensive or too small.

Notable to me is that the San Diego Union-Tribune is using a bloggish format for part of their fire coverage.
Note "blog" in the url.
Note also that the crappy exclamation point in “LEAP!” adds a crappy cherry on top of the crappy sundae, as I also despise punctuation in sound FX with the fire of a thousand suns.
Note that I always use “SHRIPP” for a sound effect when Emp’s suit tears—and never something like “RIPP,” which to me veers dangerously close to a literalistic sound FX like “RIP.” I have an overwhelming and not entirely explicable antipathy for literal, concept-based sound FX like “LEAP!” or “POINT!”—even in a theoretically humorous basis.
Note the bald cap (purchased) and the long braid of hair (borrowed from my Aunt Jacqui who had it removed prior to surgery when she had a terrible surfing accident several years before, that “Sister Golden Hair Surprise” hair was BEAUTIFUL).

Note the orange linen fabric I had to buy (and which now is part of a blanket Leah made if I remember right).
Note the use of my AOL address
Note there's really not much before the anti-miscegenation laws, which were passed in the early days of the state (1849 or 50). Before that the Bear Flag Republic lasted less than a year (1846), and before that status was as a Mexican and Spanish colony. I have no good sources for their legal systems in place under any of those regimes, though I'll note that community property is a holdover from Spanish law, not an American or English originated system.
Note to myself: One thing, this has been retouched a bit more than the other "spraypaint" items because there was something on the back of this image that showed through.

One possibility is that it was a reaction to the postnuclear scenarios popular at the time. _Mad Max_ and _The Road Warrior_ were dystopias too, but they were ones where human beings managed to royally screw up the planet with nuclear weapons.
One purchase I almost made last night at Home Depot was more mousetraps.
One quirk is that it burns oil at an increased rate.
One rumor I remember reading somewhere was that it might be a mini-series in 12 parts.
One sequence jumped out of me when listening to the audio because of the very funny at once insightful and dismissive definition of Science Fiction he cites.
One short.
One should merely be aware that the stages will be worked through and the ultimate stage of "Acceptance" will be reached.
One should not think that just because you hit a wall that you're doomed.
One should reach out to friends and family when one is in crisis.Not bad lessons.Simpatico Yes, it has been a long time since I've blogged.
one side now
One small thing was for pointing out these two films:
One step at a time, all things change and improve.
One stumbling block I do set up for myself is that I want to be inspired and have the work flow out effortlessly. The block is when I let that prevent me from doing more experiements.
one suitcase into the street hurled
One thing I do know - killshots are satisfying, but not as much fun as a nice rally.
One thing I feel bad about is that the area under the birdcage we've been laying a garbage bag as a catch for the seeds and shell hulls for the birds food.
One thing I may do is integrate these links, along with archived tweets, along with anything else I can think of, into the old pages of the blog - basically integrated bookmarks, blog posts, tweets, and photos retroactively.
One thing I've been meaning to write about was the Reality Show I auditioned for.
One thing I've done is started reading RSS and Atom feeds again.
One thing in particular caught my eye: "The Army even gives soldiers accounts to set up password-protected sites." (from the pilotonline link above).
One thing in particular I thought fascinating was that when she was a young girl, and doing portraits of people, often she would destroy what she made soon after making them because she said she did not want them floating around to haunt her.
One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here.
One thing of note is that I changed her former blog url structure, which included the post_id as part of it.
One thing that struck me about what the witnesses were saying- after the assassination attempt in Dujail, so much of what later unfolded is exactly what is happening now in parts of Iraq.
One thing that's being established is a words area, for pieces which are not journal items, not portfolio items, and stand on their own in some way.
One thing that's interesting is that in the 15 years or so since Watchmen was originally published by DC as a comic book, the realm of what's possible in terms of visual effects has expanded immeasurably.
One thing though, about Sunday.
One thing: When the Dentist looks at your wisdom tooth, and says "Oh Wow," how can you not be scared?
One tomorrow.
One visitor from stands out: Jenny and Joe @ Griffith Park Observatory, 1996.
One was from Jenny who had this to say: How bout a list of things you do like? eating corn from a can, raquetball, zappa, homemade enchiladas, etc.
One was my Grandmother & Grandfather, and the other was my Mom.
One way is to burden them with hopelessly heavy tuition debt.
One which made me want to do further research for myself.
One, I knew that it was indeed a rat I had seen, I had confused and deceived myself about the size of what I'd seen last week.

Our friend Tracy was supposed to go, but she was in a car wreck the other day, and found out today that the car is a total loss.

Our management always goes crazy, 'cause we all tell how old we are, and we're not ashamed of the fact that some of us are in our mid- to late-30s.
Our mortality is the subject of so much art.
Our music is noisy pop, often with unusual song structure, and the video ranges from abstract color noise to actual hacked and deconstructed Atari 2600 games
Our new houseguests are big fans of the Narnia books.
Our next event big event is slated for March 27th so mark your calendar.

Our prior landlord would work with us when we were a little late, but the current one, no way.
Our purpose in this is to express our belief and to testify that G-d is the Creator of the Universe, and is the source, on an ongoing basis, of all creative forces within it. Note in the text that there is a specific reference to this word "God", but the middle letter is masked.
Our quest was for dry-mouth combat tools.
Our records show that you are an experienced IT professional with experience in Web Master.
Our sense of our own history is so queerly warped.
Our Shockinis are also a bit more filled out so you have more to work with, again they are a block figure not a stick figure.
Our social calendar is full.
Our stimulus payment from the IRS was credited to our outstanding balance too (nice!) and they sent us a nice letter to that effect.
Our taxes were almost entirely NORMAL (W-2) as opposed to contract (1099), which meant that we did end up overpaying, which meant that it subtracted a huge chunk from our outstanding balance.
Our team worked very hard to try and build a service that would truly help bloggers of all sizes get free traffic to their blogs. This was our primary focus. Not once did we ever try to monetize the service with ads or anything else. BlogRush never made a single penny in revenue. We wanted to be able to help our users FIRST and then worry about monetizing the service later. Unfortunately, the service didn't work out like we had hoped. (It happens.)
Our understanding is enhanced, and more accurate when we find things in situ.

Over the years I've enjoyed detailed analyses and criticisms and highlights of great comics work.

Panther has proved more stable than the previous version of the OS, called Jaguar, suffering none of the dreaded kernel panics that occasionally afflicted Jaguar, Pole said. 'We've had tremendous interest from federal, state and local governments because of the security of a Unix foundation,' said Ken Bereskin, director of Mac OS X product marketing. 'Every aspect of the OS has been enhanced, from the drivers to the kernel.' One feature of OS X 10.3 that could be particularly useful to federal customers is the FileVault 128-bit real-time encryption.

Perhaps I will scan it and put it here.
Perhaps I'd have my domain name engraved, so they could look me up!
Perhaps I'll even share some of my own thoughts about this past week.
Perhaps I'll find some.Joseph Christian LeyendeckerHalf an hour ago there was an earthquake - 4.5 on the Richter Scale.
Perhaps I'll get a T-Shirt with it.
Perhaps I'll make up some of the Soyrizo I bought at Henry's Marketplace this weekend.
Perhaps I'll sell them on eBay.
Perhaps I'll start a web based RT employment agency.
Perhaps I'm imagining what kind of swimming I would be doing if I had to swim to shore after a shipwreck: perhaps evade sharks (faster swimming); forage for food (underwater); hail a passing rescue helicopter (backstroke).
Perhaps in another one I refer to myself as "Joseph Crawford." Also, you can read that in 2006 I had a contract with Laurel Springs School in Ojai, California.
Perhaps in expiating these exhibits we'll actually find that my good feeling is unjustified.
Perhaps it is.
Perhaps it is.Monday SchmondayThis article: Blogs in Geekland mentions my very own sandiegobloggers.com site.
Perhaps it will grow with time?
Perhaps it would be good as a MovableType blog with comments?
Perhaps it's a result of remembering how "Xerox machines" were tightly controlled in the old Soviet Union.
Perhaps it's time to again try for a Zappa style arrangement, though that particular arrangement freaks Leah out a little because it reminds her some jerk.
Perhaps it's time to check them out.
Perhaps it's time to do some drawing when I get some clear time.
Perhaps it's time to quote some Ronald Reagan, as I did on this very forum 10 years ago:
Perhaps more in a bit, but that's the quickie post I can muster before my hour expires. :-)
Perhaps New Year's?
Perhaps part of the reason is that the gardeners of that site actively promote the best comments.
Perhaps regionally based bloglists are retrogressive (opposite of progressive).
Perhaps she'd say that she really liked the film, but it was rather more intense than she expected.
Perhaps some basketball with my lady today.
Perhaps some other urban pseudo-apostate, pseudo-devout Catholics to see my name -- in 2107, or 2207, or even 2507 -- and wonder -- "just who was that Joe Crawford?"
Perhaps someday.
Perhaps something like an Assumption into Heaven, with heavens parting and a white light.
Perhaps sometime.
Perhaps talk like mine is not productive, but I'm a curious guy, and my mind wanders to the bigger picture. 37% of the eligible public voting is not something to be proud of.
Perhaps that'll change at some point.
Perhaps that's just desperation.
Perhaps that's my natural recoil from being too specific here.
Perhaps the film will be one worth watching and re-watching over the next 25.Who Watches the Watchmen?I like these three shots of Moorpark, taken with my cellular telephone's camera.
Perhaps the Moebius Silver Surfer story.
Perhaps the most egregious error is that Apple's team relied on quality control by algorithm and not a process partially vetted by informed human analysis.
Perhaps the most important reason for completing the Honors GE Core Curriculum is the possibility of earning priority admissions consideration at a number of prestigious universities, including UCLA, UC Santa Cruz, UC Riverside, UC Irvine, Pomona College, and Chapman University.
Perhaps the nicest perk is that I get to play my music collection.
Perhaps the reason we don't see more of what I want is because few can actually do the kind of research and thinking to put them together.
Perhaps there needs a site for personal ads for people who would never place a personal ad?half-jokingly...steveandnatty.com, mentioned before, have updated their amazing travelogue » Go there already!Steve and Natty's Excellent Adventure, Updated You can get FZ:OZ here (it's from 1976, new, live, from Australia, and is great -- I really like the version of "Take Your Clothes Off When You Dance" on this double CD -- also, my name's in the liner notes (middle page of the liner notes, lower right quadrant) because I preordered.
Perhaps there needs to be a gossip column like Defamer or Gawker to cover science-fiction luminaries and their various personal intrigues.
Perhaps there's a way to make this happen without having all the money in the world.
Perhaps they were indulging in nostalgia, but it sounds like a project that was fun to make.
Perhaps time to play my Dad at racquetball? ...
Perhaps tomorrow.
Perhaps tomorrow.The quote in the new header is from Confucius.I have lots of JavaScript experience.
Perhaps we'd go to Roadhouse afterwards.
Perhaps when I get a chance I'll get a set and do some work.
Perhaps you can think of some?
Perhaps you think me mad.Dare I step my toe into usenet?
Perhaps you will too.
Perhaps you'd hear something on the radio and not hear the artist or name of the song and that sound might get trapped in your head for a long time.
Perhaps you'll be sated by these links: The Museum of Ramen From alt.humor.best-of-usenet : a very funny response to software pirates A song about Joseph I don't own any older recorded music.
Perhaps you're confused.
Perhaps you're interested in learning more about Half Century Phenomenon The Grateful Dead?

Pogo for MondayHurrumph.
Pogo's "SquareBob SpongeMix":
Point 1: This is extraordinarily silly. Every traveler I know has stories of knives being missed by airport security. No one who flies regularly thinks that the TSA is doing a good job of keeping sharp objects off airplanes. Even worse, no one who flies regularly thinks that keeping sharp objects off airplanes makes us all safer. Most of what the TSA does is security theater -- window dressing. It keeps up appearances, and maybe (hopefully) makes the terrorists a little less sure they can smuggle their weapons aboard airplanes. Probably not.
Point 2: This is, and should be treated as, a crime. "I was only testing security" is not a valid defense. For years, we in the computer security field have been hearing that excuse. Because the hacker didn't intend harm, because he just broke into the system and just looked around, it wasn't a real crime. Here's a thought experiment for you. Imagine you return home and find the following note attached to your refrigerator: "I was testing the security of back doors in the neighborhood and found yours unlocked. I just looked around. I didn't take anything. You should fix your lock." Do you feel violated? Of course you do.
Point 3: While it is a crime, it isn't a terribly serious crime. Heatwole's stunt was embarrassing, and cost a whole lot of money to investigate and clean up. It could have disrupted the travel schedules of lots of people. But he's not a terrorist. He didn't do this to feed security information to al Qaeda. His actions didn't endanger anyone's lives. There's a tendency to want to throw the book at him because he embarrassed important government officials, but that's not a good enough reason. We need to discourage this behavior, but the punishment needs to fit the crime. Treat Heatwole as a criminal, but not a serious criminal.

Poupard and others at the news conference were asked about the religion-science debate raging in the United States over evolution and "intelligent design."
Poupard, for his part, stressed that what was important was that "the universe wasn't made by itself, but has a creator." But he added, "It's important for the faithful to know how science views things to understand better."

Prince Bandar used to come by the Kennebunkport compound of the bushes so often his nickname was "Bandar Bush."

Readers who do not wish to be exposed to my political opinions but instead would prefer some more fun scans of Star Wars Characters should skip this entry.
Reading a teleprompter, maybe even writing copy occasionally.
Reading at length requires focus.
Reading has been the means of my education.
Reading it is the same feeling as looking at unpleasant photos of an accident.
Reading it now, some 10 months later, it occurs to me that I could have skipped the uncomfortable moment where I found out what this San Fernando Valley idiot does for a living had I said to him, up front, that I can't talk to him, as I am working on my email.

Reagan was a great leader, he didn't pay attention, he was all flash, he made bold proclamations, he cheated on his wife, he made for great television, he reached out to Gorbachev, he financed Islamists, he brought us out of malaise, he raised taxes, he was against big government, he promoted the untenable and impossible Star Wars, he won reelection, he liked jellybeans, he fell asleep at cabinet meetings, he joked about bombing Russia, by all accounts he was a genial man.

Roth said very seriously, something like "that's great, though my experience is that those kids tend not to do so great, it's true" -- totally deflating the kid and not something you would expect a teacher to say.
Roth taught high school physics at Uni High -- USDHS -- University of San Diego High School.

Sam was on the show between about 1972 and 1976, prime time for me to have been watching.
Sam Watterson (years before Law & Order), OJ Simpson and Brenda Vacarro are all good.
Same concept.
Same difference.
Same thing on Facebook.

Scott Peck says, in _The Road Less Travelled_, "Life is hard." He also talks about how marriage is the institution which smooths our rough edges and lets us have a view of life from a view of love and acceptance of the essential hardness of life.
Scott Peck: "Human beings are poor examiners, subject to superstition, bias, prejudice, and a profound tendency to see what they want to see rather than what is really there."Some great quotes America is Not A Christian Nation.Remember...

Seventh Annual Bourbon Street Wine Tasting- Cabaret Noir on Thursday...The $50,000 question these days I find myself asking myself is this.
Several hundred people here.
Several members of Leah's family made drawings with the watercolor pencils, this is one of mine.
Several million points for style, that.ChuckIn reference to this post...
Several million years ago I used to work alongside a fellow Respiratory Therapist named Dave.
Several months ago I went north to see him play with "The Cover Problem" in Los Angeles.
Several of her top ten videos are actually 30-second TV ads, in fact.
Several of the folks who got it wrong retracted, but not all.
Several of us went to see it the weekend it came out over in Simi Valley and I enjoyed it.
Several other people for another.
Several outlets have reported that Osama bin Laden needs, and gets Dialysis, why don't we hear more about this fact given that it may tend to impact how well he may or not be surviving our current offensives?
Several people! And they rock, and I thank them for their indulgence.
Several reformats were done as well.
Several weeks ago I visited my family in Virginia, primarily to see my Mom, who recently had a stroke and was subsequently diagnosed with Stage IV Renal (Kidney) Cell Carcinoma, Cancer.
Several were about government, specifically "e-gov" initiatives.
Several were, and Gallery 2 fixed that.
Several years later she let me know that had had a breast augmentation done.
Severed tendon, 10 stitches and over 3 months before she had full use again.

SharkSlayer is a new animated movie with a bizarre cast (Ziggy Marley, Will Smith, Peter Falk, and others?) coming in Fall of 2004.
Sharon George is an artist of fantasy / "goddess" art, not my taste, but she's got a killer domain name -- she got gorgeousgeorge.com Kinokuniya is a worldwide book chain, and there's one in Little Tokyo.
Sharp and in tune
She acknowledges that basically the proverbial Fat Lady has not yet sung, and that at this point we don't know how any of this will turn out.
She also added me as a sidebar link on her site.
She also asked how my trip was and wished me well.
She also had a perfect Cindy Crawford/Marilyn Monroe mole removed from her face.
She also has a blog.Site Launch - Passepar2.com For no particular reason, in no particular order.
She also has bitchin' hair, which Leah wanted a photo of so she could have her hairdresser try it out.
She also has metastases to her brain, lung and mediastinum.
She also is a Certified Financial Planner and is plain sensible about money.
She also made a black, fuzzy one for herself that reminds me of Grover.SpecialKnittingForces.orgI've updated the words section of the site.I've updated the words section of the site.This nostalgic piece on the Amiga from the always interesting Ftrain.com reminds me of my own.This nostalgic piece on the AmigaThe linkilicious Radical Bender's "Message for Now" reminds me of something.The linkilicious Radical Bender's...
She also points out that Jennifer may meet the criteria I set as well.
She also said she would try to get me an appointment soon, because she knew that what I had happening was serious business.
She also seems to have a dose of irony.
She also used the "chat" feature to regularly talk to my sister, who lives 4 hours away.
She also wanted me to come along.
She amazed her doctors by recovering almost completely in four weeks.
She and Daniel have been together for a long while, and we're so happy for them both.
She and my father visited at Thanksgiving and that was pretty fun.
She argues that if you have a cause, then do the research to back up your cause.
She arrived VERY late at SEATAC.
She asked if it was cool for her to reveal that aspect of the book (that I'm the "Jac" at the end") and I feel like, no problem at all.
She asked me how I felt.
She asked me yesterday if saw this photo Dooce ((*Dooce is what I call Heather Armstrong, I'm very nearly incapable of referring to her as anything different.
She attended both the panels and the cocktail parties, but was not doing a panel or minding Amy Sedaris.
She beat me 7 to 3 instead.
She belongs to Sam & Lori.
She came back from her main cancer doc today, and it looks like it's time for more radiation.
She can also claim Irish heritage, and appear in the Irish Abroad web magazine.
She can walk unassisted and was even dancing in her room when dad came to see her this morning.
She can't cite a newspaper or a magazine she's ever read.
She can't name a Supreme Court decision.
She cared about me, I think, and liked the attention I gave to her.
She certainly has many people praying for her: Catholic, Christian, New Age, Jewish, Agnostic, Mormon, and even Atheists. (Probably more than that even).
She certainly seems to have enough pieces to warrant a book.
She chose a new theme and she took very fast to customizing it with her various (incredible!) writing and online projects.
She claims blogs should not contain musings or personal thoughts or the like.
She continues to moderate her diet and habits to try and stay healthy.
She continues to recover from her surgery.
She could have been an extra in a John Hughes movie! (Probably Sixteen Candles).
She could see how shook up I was by it.
She credits her recovery to the hundreds of people who heard about her condition and prayed for her.
She cultivated a quick wit and intellect and loved to debate, always maintaining a conservative stance.
She dances
She dances and the world is new
She describes new love as a kind of temporary insanity.
She did a nice mix of old and new, China was an emotional highlight for me -- I found myself oddly emotional for the show.
She did not drive, at least that I can remember.
She did not go to my high school.
She did not really understand that we owned her.
She did not take any guff.
She did some stuff about it.
She did, and she very much enjoyed it.
She didn't graduate from San Diego State College but she made an effort to always be learning.
She died as she lived, defying and exceeding expectations.
She digs that show.
She does a version of The Tennessee Waltz that blows me away.
she does the unthinkable absurd
She drank green tea, I had mint cocoa.
She draws too.
She drives a new Thunderbird
She drives the Venus Scrander that flies into the back of her head.
She even had some chicken noodle soup before the end of the night.
She even offered retinal scans if I wanted them.
She excoriates many in this piece, and writes from a historical perspective that gets missed in all the talk of a "War On Terror." Check it... But as a chain of suicide bombers steadily blew up buses and restaurants in Israel over the past year, my sympathy for the Palestinian cause has gradually diminished.
She expects that others do the same.
She extended her hand and we shook hands.
She flirts back but he gets NO name.
She gave me a good talking to, stressing the fact that there was no notice given for this outlandish trip.
She gave up her keys to the apartment, and we both signed a document I drafted that laid out the circumstances as they are.
She got a cover on Fahrenheit's print pub a few weeks ago, and she needs a site to showcase and sell her work. (Joe goes looking for links to her stuff) DAMN.
She got diagnosed with cancer, and looked forward to working in a soup kitchen.
She got it after having worked at the Norris Medical Library as USC back in the mid-1970s.

Sometimes I went alone.
Sometimes I would do chest compressions, with the lockstep rhythm working to jump-start someone's body to life.
Sometimes I'll argue that Dick and Lovecraft were the most influential writers of the Twentieth Century (though when I'm in that mood I'm more likely to argue that The Pixies have been far more influential than The Beatles, but that's neither here nor there) because even though their actual, you know, writing and stories were kind of crap, their ideas defined, predicted, categorized and possibly invented the fucked up world we live in: that the world is vastly larger and more complicated than you can possibly comprehend, and that you are surrounded by conspiracies -- real, existing ones -- that desperately want to hide from you who you are and what is really pressing in around you.
Sometimes I'm more down than others.
Sometimes if someone I know is sick or in particular need I'll dedicate the fire to them.
Sometimes it seems utterly impossible that she won't be going to see the latest Oprah-endorsed film with us.
Sometimes it snows at West Point.
Sometimes it's fun.
Sometimes it's hard to live far from family.Commute
Sometimes it's just a "this house was just painted by Acme Painting Co." -- and usually it's "this house is for sale" -- but sometimes it's a "for rent" or "for lease" sign.
Sometimes it's out of not wanting to share, or maybe it's shame for how things are not exactly how I want them to be in my life.
Sometimes it's really hard to believe that each day is a new day.Not a great knightit's hokey, but it's a nice basis for some other things. why didn't i go looking for this last night when i was slamming my head against stupid code? ugh.
Sometimes it's really hard to live far away from my folks.
Sometimes it's to take a photo or two.
Sometimes magic." in Chapter 1: Envisioning a Site That Won't Be Featured In suck.com.
Sometimes not a good adventure.
Sometimes one is just right on, and a link pops out to me to share.
Sometimes simple is best.
Sometimes such wanderings turn into blog posts.
Sometimes that's all the information you have to go on.
Sometimes that's how life is.
Sometimes the emotion attendant to missing my mother kicks me in the teeth, sometimes it just seems vaguely sad, sometimes it just feels like an error. "I'm sorry, did you say 'my mother is dead?'--because I'm afraid you're mistaken, we just ate lunch with her the other day."
Sometimes the Internet is a marvelous thing, especially when it allows you to meet one of the most beautiful people in the world.

Sometimes you learn as much from the things you don't like as from the things you do like.
Sometimes you want to talk, and it's a really dumb idea.
Sometimes, it's about the simple things.
Sometimes, one does not even realize that one concept has been confused for the other.

Soon enough I got a reply to my phone saying:

Soon enough it was time for the 1:20pm show of Prince Caspian at the El Capitan.
Soon enough Kai was done, and I was alone in the lane.
Soon enough, it'll look different again.
Soon I'll be leaving this cafe -- the It's a Grind coffeehouse.
Soon I'll take a breath and talk more seriously and at more length about: changes in my personal life, changes in my professional life, and upgrades to my educational life.
Soon I'm out the door
Soon the doorbell rang.
soon the morning will arrive
Soon wakefulness in the middle of the night.
Soon you can controll the world.." though their mispelling of "control" does give me pause as to targeting teachers... "XIPSTER is the hottest new way to introduce animation into the classroom.

Stanley Kubrick.
Stanley Prusiner, the Nobel Prize-winning researcher who this week called the current United States practice of weaning calves on cattle blood protein "stupid." All of this would be very vindicating, except for one problem: the millions of dollars that the government and industry are spending on PR to pull the wool over the public's eyes might just succeed in forestalling the necessary steps that now, at this late date, must still be taken to adequately deal with this crisis.

State election statistics from this PDF file from www.ss.ca.gov. Eligible voters in 2003: 21,833,141 Actually registered eligible voters: 15,380,536 Percentage of eligible actually registered: 70.45% On the question of the recall, 7,978,767 voted (4,416,280 + 3,562,487) So if we crunch these further: Percentage of eligible voters to vote for Arnold: 3,744,132 / 21,833,141 -- 17% Percentage of registered voters to vote for Arnold: 3,744,132 / 15,380,536 -- 24% Percentage of eligible voters who bothered to show up and vote at all: 7,978,767 / 21,833,141 -- 36.5% Percentage of registered voters who bothered to show up and vote all: 7,978,767 / 15,380,536 -- 51.9% What I'm saying is despite all the wonderful excitement about how engaged we all are in this political process, in my opinion these numbers are low - and I'm not talking about Arnold as much as I'm talking about people getting involved in government at any level.

Stew and Heidi were recently commissioned by the Public Theater of New York to develop a new work for the stage.

Stew is a great favorite.
Stew of The Negro Problem
Stew on NPR Onward to the workweek!Next verse, same as the first...
Stew records never include lyrics, so it's up to the fans.
stew sez, originally started back in 2003 for stew to vent some writing, has been given a facelift and new interface -- it's a blog.
Stew Sez, which I put together for Stew, has some wonderful wierdness on it.
Stew was right when he shared with the audience that any artist couldn't put out a record like this, even the hardest rapper wouldn't dare make allusions to sexual interactions with underage girls as boldly as this song does.
STEW, a popular performer at Joe's Pub, was commissioned by The Public to develop this moving and hilarious story of a young black bohemian in search of self and home who charts a course for "the real" through sex, drugs, and rock and roll.
Stew, Something Deeper Than These Changes (***) On his solo outings, of which this is the third, the lead singer of L.A. pop eccentrics the Negro Problem is frequently compared to Burt Bacharach.

Stew's post struggles with the very notion of going mainstream.
Stew's words are lovable to me precisely because he woos the muse of the odd.

Forcefully dumb TV (Tom Green, Jackass, Man Show, etc.) I think you are also being too hard on this. I can understand finding Tom Green annoying, but Jackass?

The Internet is perhaps the best symbol of everything disquieting to boomers (and their elders) about the present, including the generational divide with respect to technology.

The internet remembers.
The intersection of the current conflict and internet (journalism, blogging, news alerts, news aggregators, email, etc) is an interesting one - and *this* topic (as opposed to more general talk positive/negative on the war) seems ripe for discussion.
The interview is both interesting and moving, as the author says he came from a very literal, Evangelical faith of "The Book" -- and had his faith shaken when he realized the historical ambiguities and inconsistencies in the writings of the early Christians.
The irony is Leah's going into work when she arrives, and by the time work is over, and she's on her way home, I'll be off to my first class at Moorpark College.
The irony is that reading about this is in a sense precisely what those claiming responsibility want.
The irony of the thing is that apparently the diet that lost me 90 pounds in 9 months is the same diet that accelerated my tooth decay.
The irrationality and mania of new love is wonderful, but it is not, uh, encouraging of rational decision-making.

The IRS debt looms largest, because they are the dog with the most menacing teeth, but for now we're paying nice and regularly and we're on track to be ahead of the game for 2008's taxes as well.

The key is to find the balance that serves us both emotionally, mentally, physically, and spiritually.
The key is to retain hope, and to share the journey with people on the same trip.
The key thing is to take care of _me_.
The key, though, is that democracies have a process for creating such restrictions, and as a citizen it sickens me to see the US trying to take shortcuts.
The key?
The keys are to the house, the mailbox, the car, actually the other three are to uh... okay, I'm not sure, but it's only three keys I don't know, and NOT 500, but when I need them I'll have the last laugh!

The kids and their Dad and Stepmom are all going to Spain this week and next so we'll miss them but I gave Al my super-portable Spanish/English dictionary.
The kids are looking forward to seeing their cousins and I'm looking forward to sleeping.
The kids have rooms! They have two homes now.
The kids listen to me and ideally I'm expanding their mind to the possibilities and perils of life.
The kids really seem to like this show.
The kids rode ATVs in the snow and enjoyed it.
The kids were discouraged from learning Spanish.

The leadership of Secretary Bob Gates in DOD has produced a dramatic transformation of our national security effort which under the Rumsfeld leadership was characterized by: a failing under-resourced counter-insurgency strategy; illegal DOD orders on the abuse of human rights; disrespect for the media and the Congress and the other departments of government; massive self-denial on wartime intelligence; and an internal civilian-imposed integrity problem in the Armed Forces -- that punished candor, de-centralized operations, and commanders initiative.
The left's selective empathy is shocking.
The lesson for me is that I'm going to make mistakes, but that I need to think before I act.
The lesson of this post, incomplete as it is, is this: HARDWARE SUCKS.
The lesson on these Starbursts is that the tropical flavored ones have wrappers that look just about the same as the regular ones, but they just don't taste good enough, and taste too different from the regular that they are surprising in a bad way.

The Lincoln Memorial is by far my favorite place in Washington, D.C.
The line was "one of em's dead, ya can't go see 'em." It's not a particularly funny line.
The lines of communication are so great that we find we can talk about work, about family, about outside relationships we are having, about travel, about movies, everything.
The lines of communication are super-open, and we are talking and communicating.

The Militant will now provide a (by no means comprehensive) list of sites and blogs from around the country, via his Militant research, which declare the drivers of their respective locales (including some known for frequent precipitation) as people who "Can't drive in the rain."
The military, which has gone to untold lengths to brag every chance it can since 9/11 that homeland security is job #1, still seems to be under the impression that it requires an engraved invitation from a Constitutional Congress to get off its collective ass and respond rapidly to a domestic emergency.
The military's strong bias against involving itself with civilian situations reveals itself as a weird sort of inability to take charge in situations that naturally demand it.

The movie makes me cry.
The movie reflects not only distrust of government, but also features the crusading reporter as hero; All the President’s Men, about Woodward and Bernstein and Watergate, had already been a hit movie two years earlier.

THE NAME OF THIS BAND IS TALKING HEADS offers an unusual take on the concert album--rather than a "souvenir of a single night's show," it captures the band's live evolution from 1977 to 1981.
The name of this song is King Kong.
The names in the concrete are impressive enough, but I asked Leah "is it possible that things can be both dingy and glamorous?" Her answer was a simple "yes." All that said, it was fun to see the names again, and see the newer names.

The non-basketball highlight of the Santa Barbara trip, besides Tyler driving was going to Freebirds World Burrito for great burritos! They are a bit spendy -- but it's rather like a Subway for burritos and quesadillas - pick "Regular" or "Monster" size flour tortilla, then choose toppings -- refried beans, rice, black beans, steak, broiled chicken, pork, guacamole, cheese, pico de gallo, onion, lettuce, sour cream, tomato -- get one or five or whatever you want!

The non-specificity of that phrase: "the holy Creator of time" is really interesting to me. "Creator" is a much better and less loaded phrase than "God" or "god" or "G-d" -- whose invocation is so ubiquitous as to be uttered all the time. "Oh my god" is so common a phrase, and in repetition, perhaps the meaning, and interpretability of the phrase, and the word, begins to mean nothing.

This is a worse option in every respect except one, which is that it may be possible.
The other word Leah does not care for is "giddy." Giddy's a fine word, and I actually like to be giddy, but I think I must say it in a way that is not totally in the spirit of love or something, like giddy is a negative.

The PHP code has not changed a great deal from 2010:
The PHP code I hacked together was this:
The php for that I had written when I really knew very little php, and I ended up with the search engine indexing not just /words/accessibility/?i=0 to /words/accessibility/?i=10, but it was iteratively visiting the "next" and "previous" links like crazy. ?i=-1, ?i=-2, ?=-3, and on until I stopped it at ?i=-115.

The place is, after all, owned by Disney.
The plain answer is that it feels honest to do so.
The plain ones are the only ones I can tolerate.
The plan as it stands is for us to separate next month.
The plan for Saturday I mentioned before.

The song and I think the video too were released in 1990.
The song has a perfect hook too.
The song in my head which I was unable a good copy of from either on iTunes, Amazon MP3 store, or via skreemr is Oblivious by Aztec Camera.
The song is called "Lily Pads and Rock Cod." I surely hope you enjoyed it.
The song is disturbing, sad, about death, but still has a braggadocio that's really odd.
The song is from the 1940s but the words still apply.
The song is pretty unbelievable when you think about it.
The song is sung with a very real emotion.
The song itself, and riffing word combinations with Tony.
The song of course talks about a bald-faced racism of some Southerners, but also points out that the North is not much better, blacks are free, but only to a point:

The thing I come away with is that anyone can do this blogging stuff, which is what I believed before too.
The thing I keep coming back to is that this kind of "screen scraping the world" as in the Amazon Maps views that came out some years ago (doing basically what Google's done here, but a bit clunkier), geotagging of photos on photo sharing sites, etc. ... will only get more real-time, not less. I suppose there will be a view on these maps sometime for "live view" at some point.

The title of this article is great from diveintomark.org: The myth of RSS compatibility: There are 9 versions of RSS, all of which are incompatible with various other versions.
The title of this post is the only proper response to the fact that the front of websandiego.org was a directory listing for about 20 hours.
The titles are: Alias, Angel, Bufffy the Vampire Slayer, Charmed, Smallville, and Stargate SG-1, and a catchall magazine called Dreamwatch. At first I was laughing at the prospect that people had that much of a need for news about the show Charmed, but then I realized that there is a magazine called CBS Soaps in Depth, dedicated only to the goings on of CBS soap operas. So maybe people really need a magazine for Stargate SG-1.Titan MagazinesAt the Con the Star Wars people had a booth where you could pretend to be an action figure.

The trick is for me to find the voice of calm that is inside me.
The trick is that maybe we didn't exist as we know existence to be, but perhaps in the minds of our parents as an idea of _having children_.
The trick is to arrange those flowers - those same f*cking flowers that everyone else has been dealt from Robert Johnson to Avril Lavigne - and come up with something that transcends the limitations.

The Vatican project STOQ has organized academic courses and conferences on the relationship between science and religion and is hosting its first international conference on "the infinity in science, philosophy and theology," next week.
The Vatican project was inspired by Pope John Paul II's 1992 declaration that the church's 17th-century denunciation of Galileo was an error resulting from "tragic mutual incomprehension." Galileo was condemned for supporting Nicolaus Copernicus' discovery that the Earth revolved around the sun; church teaching at the time placed Earth at the center of the universe.

The WordPress Graphical Post Count Visualization tool I built last year was a similar effort to give people a sense of how many posts there are.
The words on this page: What is a Freethinker? ring so true to me.
The work of his that I've enjoyed the most was his Mighty Mouse in the 1980s.
The workday was shot after 3pm.
The working theory is it's for selling links.
The works were realized on a VAX 11/780 computer, a Mark 1I 32-bit frame buffer, Symbolics 3670 and/or Evans and Sutherland PS 300 and in-house software.
The world around me disappears, and in that building time I am lost in the process.
The world is already so full of cheats, scoundrels and liars perhaps we don't need a special day to make it seem funny.
The world is at once small, and yet vast in scope.
The world is scary in different ways.
The world is suddenly a far less interesting place.
The world is that way, and I like my places to talk and socialize to not be so much like the world.
The world is upended right now, and things are upended for me a bit at the moment, but this too shall pass, with determination, hard work, and some proper meditative calm.
The world is worse.
The world seems to be returning to bubble-style nuttiness.
The World.
The world's most populous nation is unlikely to build lunar settlements, but that's not the point.
The worriers.
The worse news is that they don't really hope to have the fires under control until November 4th, next Tuesday.
The Worst Candy I Ever Ate In My Life
The wrinkle is that they have two kids, boys, one is maybe 10, the other 17.
The writers and directors should be blamed just as much as the studios because really everything seems to be a remake or adapting a 1970s TV show that was never particularly good.
The writing is preceded by a long period of "sitting grumpily, staring out the window." That explains why his nine books, all of which are still in print, have appeared at unpredictable intervals. "The typing on the keyboard takes about a year.
The writing: my own frustrations with mobile publishing triggered a neat idea.
The WWW flourished because anyone with Notepad could build a website, whether you know the difference between semantic markup, schemas, document type definitions, or any of it.
The xhtml even validates!
The yearbook is from 1991, the colorization was me doing PhotoShop for a class at UCLA Extension in 1995.
The years after my mother died, far less.
The yellow represents the list when I was running the list but had moved away.
The young man always seems to have stray hardware from building game PCs.
The young might not have learned this lesson yet.
The Zappa picture I got from St.
The.
Their animation is sort of wonderful.
Their beady eyes bulged, and the veins in their tiny narrow foreheads beat in rage.
Their best song is Turn The Heater On - a hauntingly beautiful song in a vast repetoire of haunting and beautiful work.
Their comic art not only reflected the dominant motifs of the '60s, from the futuristic idealism of Infantino to the cinematic realism of Adams, but most importantly, the superheroes they drew changed -- from establishment conservatives like Superman, The Flash and Green Lantern to counterculture liberals like Spider-Man, Doctor Strange and Green Arrow.
Their computers were universally slightly slower than I wanted, or maybe I was universally anxious and impatient when I talked to them.
Their Dad and Stepmom are on a trip for a while, so we gots 'em! Hopefully we'll have some fun 'round here.
their eyes are covered
Their flyer included example strips -- a smart move.
Their greatest attachment and commitment is to truth, and to learning to know and do what is right.
Their hope, while not extending beyond the grave, yet persists as long as life persists, for life is hope. (emphasis added) Freethinkers do not expect to ever see again their loved ones who have died.
Their intended methodology sounds terrific.
their knees wobble and they start to weave
Their listeners and viewers will now be even more enraged, even more frustrated, even more disappointed in everybody except the responsibility-free talkers on television and radio.
Their one-page website tells me nothing about whether or not I might want to read their comics.
Their perception, then, is not in sync with time, so their conception of the world around them, being largely blind, is based on this older information.
Their philosophy is to let Red Hat be Red Hat and install itself on variable hardware with proper drivers.
Their pools were huge! When I was done, they even had one of those swimsuit-spinner things that dries out your suit.
Their speculations were incorrect, because I remembered another piece of Audio I had listened to, Adam Bosworth speaking at the MySQL Developer's Conference in 2005.
Their stuff is for both Windows and Macintosh.
Their style of play varied from punk to pop rock and they had fans of all ages.
Their visionary, polyrhythmic stew combined funk and punk with African beats, avant-garde minimalism, and pure pop.
Their website says "With XIPSTER in your hands your creativity can run wild.

TINSEL TOWN CLUB! Senator Ernest Hollings and a powerful group of Hollywood entertainment interests are pushing Congress to pass an anti-consumer bill called the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act (CBDTPA) that may make it impossible to: » Play your CDs on your desktop computer » Create legal copies or mp3s of the music that you own to play in your car, or listen to while you exercise » Create mix-CDs of music you've paid for This is not the way copyright law is supposed to work. Tell your member of Congress that you value your fair use rights and don't want Hollywood to control technological innovation.

We're turning into a packed house.
We're using a backup system of every-room-gets-a-fan and take-it-easy-during-the-day.
We're waiting in line and the guy ahead of us in line -- a thin 40_50-something thin fellow with a well-trimmed beard -- he turns around and sees us, breathing hard (yes, all of us were breathing hard, not just me, the paunchy 30-something guy!) and says to Ty "You look just like your dad!" -- and Alex, Tyler and I all look at each other and give out the biggest giggle ever.

We've been tumblr-ing for 16 months now.
We've created such a highly engaged and interactive array of systems that we are now afraid to use them.
We've forgotten that a whole lot of smart people used to wake up every day thinking that that day could well be the day the world ended.
We've gotten a chance to do some good and serious talking, and had fun too.
We've grown up.
We've had a few bets of a penny, or a quarter, or a dollar.
We've had another session of couples counseling - and it went well.
We've had enough.
We've had no other evidence than that -- no droppings, no other evidence of rodents since last July.
We've made some amazing progress in counseling these past few months.
We've moved from Usenet and Friendster to MySpace, and now to Twitter and Facebook as mechanisms to connect people.
We've paid rent on-time and with a great track record for good communication with our landlords for 2 years, and my income track record for those two years has been great.
We've started looking, though Leah considers it too early to be taken seriously.
We've switched from a culture that was interested in manufacturing, economics, politics — trying to play a serious part in the world — to a culture that's really entertainment-based.
We’ll be updating this site regularly, so check back often!

What I saw was scattered waders in the water with no wetsuits.

You will resent me for your curfew and the fact that I will not let you leave the house in that mini-skirt.
You will text message your friends to tell them that I am the most horrible person on the planet because I'm forcing you to study for your exam in the morning.
You won't see anything yet.

Your product should be a hierarchy.
Your reason is now mature enough to examine this object.
Your shoes are scanned, and various small but vital objects in your pockets can be confiscated by semi-educated security geeks. They're either pathetically under-trained for the job (in which case you certainly feel no safer), or else they are intelligent and capable people (in which case you pity them and wish they had some other job, for the sake of general human happiness and the GNP). Rather than making us any safer, Terrorspace airports serve as political indoctrination centers that humiliate our voting population on a broad scale.

Zappa believed that the competence was a much more laudable goal, and he was famous for working himself, and the people who worked for him, like crazy.

Zappa in Rehearsal, 1973We (Leah, the kids, and I) went to Utah for Christmas.
Zappa is not named for the great Frank Zappa, or at least not directly.

Zappa, 1973 or so.I'm listening to the song Son of Mr.
Zappa.
Zappa's theory was that the masses delude themselves into thinking that they too could be stars, and that was somehow important.
